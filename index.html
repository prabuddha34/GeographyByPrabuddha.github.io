<h3>Very Short Questions</h3>

      </div>
      <div id="Questions">
<p>Question 1: What is a Flat land?</p>
<p> Land varying between 20 metres to 40 metres above sea level, is called flat land. This type of area has sufficient slope for natural drainage. This area is generally suitable for farming.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Question 2: What do you understand by the term Grid?</p> 
<p>A Grid is a set of lines used to find the exact location of places on a map. Most maps use the grid formed by latitudes and longitudes to find places.</p>     
<p>Question 3: What are ‘National Grid Reference’?</p>

<p>Grid lines are imaginary lines drawn on a survey map in red colour. The origin of the Grid is a point south-west of the map. The ‘National Grid Reference’ is used for indicating the correct position of a particular feature on the map.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Question 4: Describe the importance of colours on the toposheet?</p>
<p>The use of various colours are essential to show the various features on the toposheet e.g. the cultivated area is always shown by the yellow colour and the green colour on the toposheet, shows the forested and wooded area.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Question 5: What do you understand by a causeway?</p>
<p> It is raised metalled road constructed over a stream, river, railway line or low lying marshy area.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Question 6: What is a Fire line?</p>
<p>Fire line is the path which is cleared around the forest to prevent the spreading of fire.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Question 7: What is a River system ?</p>

<p>Rivers generally rise on slopes and are joined by a large number of other small rivers or streams. The entire area drained by a rivet and its tributaries is called a river system.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Question 8: How is the importance of settlement reflected in a map?</p>
<p>The importance of settlement is reflected by its size and the number of routes which meet there.</p>

<h2 id="short">Short Questions</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p>Question 1: What is a “Topographical Map”?</p>
<p>Topographical map gives detailed information about physical features and man-made features of a small area. Physical features are depicted by contours. Cultural or man made features are represented by symbols called conventional signs.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Question 2: What is a scale?</p>
<p>A scale is very essential for a map because it represents a large area of a country on a small piece of paper. A scale is the ratio between any two points on a map to the corresponding distance between the same two points on the actual ground.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
  Question 3: What are the three methods of indicating scale on maps?</p>
<p>Three methods of indicating scale on maps are:
  (i) By a statement     (ii) By representative fraction
  (iii) By graphical scale or linear scale.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>Question 4: Convert the following scales into R.F.
  </p>
  <p> If a scale is 2 cm., to 1 km., calculate the R.F.

<br>
<br>
<p>Question 6: What do you mean by ‘Marginal Information’?</p>
<p>Marginal Information can be obtained from the margin of the sheet. The name of the state to which the area belongs is given at the top of the sheet. The year when the area was surveyed is also mentioned. The number of the sheet is given in the right hand top comer. The direction of the magnetic variation and true north position is also given in the right hand top corner.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Question 7: Why are directions on a map important?</p>
<p>Since mapping is primarily a science of whereabouts a student of geography should, therefore, be familiar with directions and also the methods of finding out directions on different occasions and in various circumstances.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Question 8: Mention the methods by which directions are located.</p>
<p>Some methods by which directions can be located are:
  (i) Angular Bearing     (ii) By Magnetic Compasa
  (iii) The Pole Star        (iv) Sunrise and Sunset.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>Question 9: How the compass direction of an object, feature or place given from the given point?</p>
  <p>r: (i) Direction: The upper part of a map is North, your right hand is East and left hand West. The down part is South. You must be careful from which town or feature to give direction.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>Question 11: What is a Watershed?</p>
<p>A watershed or water divide is a ridge which separates the tributaries draining towards one side of it from those drawing towards the other. A watershed is never half way up a slope and on the two sides of it, the slope must be opposite and downwards.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Question 12: What are ‘Eastings’ and ‘Northings’?</p>
<p>The position of a certain feature on the sheets is indicated eastward and southward. The eastward lines of the grid are known as Northings. The northward lines of the grid are known as Eastings. These have been named Eastings and Northings because they indicate distances eastward and northward respectively from the point of origin.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Question 13: The area is measured by grid square method?</p>
<p> To find the area by the grid square method: The grid square on toposheet measures 2 cm × 2 cm., or 1 km., × 1 km., since 2 cm., is equal to 1 km. Therefore, the area of each square is 1 sq. km. To find particular area on a topographical map:</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>Question 14: Which colours are used on toposheets? What is their significance?</p>
<p>Six colours are used in a survey map to show various features. They are as follows:
  Black: All names, river banks, broken grounds, dry streams, surveyed trees, heights and their numbering, railway tracks, telephone and telegraph lines.
  Yellow: All cultivated areas.
  Green: All wooded/forested areas, scattered trees and scrubs.
  Brown: Contour lines, their numbering, stony waste, sand features.
  Blue: All water bodies, where they contain water.
  Red: Grid lines and their numbering, roads, cart tracks, settlements, huts and other buildings. Note: Sometimes we find white patches here and there to show barren lands.</p>

<div id="longquestion">
<h2 id="man">Long Questions</h2>
<br>
<p>Question 1: In what ways is the scale represented on a map?</p>
<p>Representation of Map Scale: Map scales are represented in the three forms:
  (i) A Statement: This is the easiest method of describing a map scale. It is usually written on maps as 1 cm., to 10 km.
  (ii) A Ratio: In this method the map scale is expressed as a numeric ratio. The numerator represents the map distance and it is always expressed as a unit. The denominator represents the corresponding ground distance, i.e., one unit on the map is equivalent to a number of units on the ground.
  It is also known as ratio-scale or Representative Fraction (R.F.)</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>Question 2: The distance is measured on the topographic map. There are two methods of measuring distance on the toposheets, (i) Direct-method, (ii) Indirect method. Measuring straight distance is a direct method and measuring through a winding course is an indirect method. Explain both the methods.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p> (i) To measure the straight distance: To measure the shortest distance between two points on the topographic map along a straight line can be done easily with the help of a pair of divider. Keep the two pointed ends of the divider over line or two points which has to be measured and then carefully keep on scale. Note down the distance on the map in centimetres; then either with the help of the graphical scale which is provided below the toposheet or by using the statement scale distance can be measured in kilometres and metres.
    e.g., two places are 5.6 km., apart on the map.
    The scale is given 2 cm. = 1 km.
    1 cm. = 1/2 km.
    5.6 cm. = 1/2 × 5.6
    = 2.8 km.
    (ii) To measure winding course: To measure a winding course route is complicated. It has to be measured with the help of a strip of paper or thread e.g., to measure a river in a toposheet take a piece of thread make a knot on one end. At the end of thread (close to knot) mark the point with pen at which you will begin to measure (point A). Put the thread along the line touching as far as possible to measure and keep on marking with ink at turns till the last point. Stretch the thread on the scale line, you will get the ground distance in kilometres and metres, writing the unit of measurement is always important e.g., if the distance calculated between two points is 3.3 km. If asked in kilometres the answer would be 3km., 300m. If asked in metres the answer would be 3300 metre</p>
<p>Question 3: What is Concave Slope and Convex Slope? Explain?</p>
<br>
<p>Concave Slope: The slope is very gentle at the foot and it goes on getting steeper and steeper towards the top. The spacing between successive contours at the lower level is more than at the higher level.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>Question 4: (i) On a topographical map two stations A and B are situated at height of 500 metres and 100 metres respectively. If the horizontal distance between them is 2 km, calculate the gradient.
  (ii) On a topographical map, two places A and B are given. Calculate the gradient between them.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>(i) Horizontal distance = 2 km = 2000 m
    Vertical difference in height = 500 – 100 = 400 metres</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>Question 5: (i) What is the importance of a Relief Map.
  (ii) How can we show occupations by the evidences of names or by inference of relief features?</p>
<p> (i) The study of relief features requires careful handling. It is a bird’s eye view of the entire . area where hills, plateau, and down lands are shown clearly. The gap between, two hills is marked. Maximum heights may be located and denoted with grid reference.
  (ii) The following list shows the occupations by the evidence of names or by inference of relief features.</p>
